        <h2>About the Developer</h2>
        <p>James Alfred Mannasala is a 3rd year Game Design and Development Major at Rochester Institute of Technology. While not too shabby in code, art is not his strong suit. He has a vested interest in JRPGs, platformers, metroidvanias, and a love of Snarky Puppy. As an aspiring creator, he looks to shake things up and to ultimately create something good for others.</p>
